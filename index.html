        <H1>What is casual?</H1>
        <p>
In general terms casual is a distributed application server. A platform to build applications on top of, that can interact with each other in a distributed manner, with or without transactional context. 

Users build logical applications that consist of one or more servers that advertise arbitrary named services. Servers are deployed in a domain. Domains can be connected with each other, on different machines, in any topology.

A server is just an executable with an entry point for each advertised service. A server is scaled by spawning processes of the executable. Hence, servers can be dynamically scaled to meet load requirements. Resources such as databases can also be associated with a server.
        </p>
        <p>
A service can call other services, and casual will find where these services reside in the topology. 

casual provides a queue implementation together with queue-to-service and queue-to-queue forward functionality. 
        </p>
<h1>Why use casual? </h1>
<p>
casualâ€™s semantics are simple and easy to reason about. 

casual applications can be scaled to fit any need. Asynchronous service calls provide massive concurrency without the hassle of threads.
</p>
<p>
With the casual building blocks: services, queues, queue-to-service and queue-to-queue, relevant communication patterns can be constructed.

casual can be managed in a UNIX-friendly way that enables interoperability with familiar tools.
