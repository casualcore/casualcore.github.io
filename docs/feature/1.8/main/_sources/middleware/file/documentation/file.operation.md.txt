# casual-file

`casual-file` is a simple and lightweight _file manager_.

`casual-file` differs from other _xa-resources_ in the form that `casual-file` is 'known' to `casual`, hence `casual` can, and does, take shortcuts regarding transaction semantics. User code does not have to bind/link to `casual-file` as an _xa-resource_, it works more like _service calls_.


## configuration

`casual-file` requires no configuration
